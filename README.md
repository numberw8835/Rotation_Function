# Matrix Rotation and Determinant Analysis

This simple Python script explores the relationship between matrix rotation and determinants. Specifically, it performs the following:

1. **Matrix Generation:** Creates a random `m x n` matrix.
2. **Rotation:**  
   - **Square Matrices:** Rotates the matrix in a clockwise ring pattern and calculates the determinant at each step.
   - **Rectangular Matrices:** Uses the Cullis-Radic pseudo-determinant for rectangular matrices.
3. **Visualization:** Generates a plot showing how the determinant changes with each rotation. The original matrix is also displayed for reference.

## Dependencies

* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Make sure you have NumPy and Matplotlib installed (`pip install numpy matplotlib`).
2. Run the script. It will automatically generate a random matrix and plot the results.
3. You can modify the values of `n` (columns), `m` (rows), and `period` (number of rotations) at the beginning of the script.

## Functions

* `cullis_radic_determinant(matrix)`: Calculates the Cullis-Radic pseudo-determinant for rectangular matrices.
* `Rot(matrix)`: Performs a clockwise ring rotation on a matrix.

## Potential Improvements

* **Efficiency:** The `Rot` function could be optimized for larger matrices.
* **Customization:** Allow the user to input their own matrix.
* **More Metrics:** Explore other matrix properties (e.g., rank, eigenvalues) in relation to rotation.
* **Interactive Plot:** Make the plot interactive, allowing the user to zoom or inspect specific points.

## Notes

* This script is intended for educational purposes and exploration. 
* The concept of matrix rotation might not have direct applications in all linear algebra scenarios.
* If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request.
